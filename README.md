# simgameserver

Short desc: Webserver for my other repo, simulation game. I wanted to test out API:s and importing my own module. 

My goal with this is to provide a consumer with quantitative data from simulations run in the simulation game, e.g. how well does a creature survive vs another in the specific environment. How does their attribute change over time? What is more valuable, speed, energy conserveration or something else?
